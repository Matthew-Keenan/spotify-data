# spotify-data
Uses Spotipy Python library to access Spotify's API and retrieve track audio data. The playlist the tracks are taken from is Spotify's 'Top Songs of 2019'. 

The audio data is processed and the mean for each audio value is displayed in a bar chart, and a scatterplot is created to display track "Danceability" and "Energy" vs track "Popularity".

My inital goal was just to get more experience with Matplotlib using some dataset, but decided to kill two birds with one stone and get experiece with retrieving data via an API too. Spotify was just chosen because I like music and thought it would be interesting.
